 the sep page would have thea same navBar <br />
 what why how referral process works<br />
 goals benefits to user <br />
 how this might could fit with salesRep <br />

-User/Referral  Data (Separate Page)
  Rewards -User 
 -keep track of which users are in the top X positions

-will show overview of section in the ureferral.jsx file
 -- this also links to a separate file, with 
	more information. the sep file/process will have the 
	navBar, tagline, as well as this section only..
	-selecting a navBar link returns to the initial/default page
	-need to figure out/decide if there will be a method to 
	 directly go to the ureferral_data.jsx page, from the 
	 navBar.. maybe a submenu item off the urefferal menu item..

	-find/discuss with the dev partner for this..
	 smooth out rough parts of the base site to have the landing page
