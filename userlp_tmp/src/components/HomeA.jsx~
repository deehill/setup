 Free textbooks!!<br />
   (*cmon.. you didn't think there are really free books)<br />

 bags of money.. large/small<br />
 buying books from us lets you have one of these when you're done!<br />
 books from us ---> leaves you this!<br />
 books from them --->> leaves you that!<br />

anybody can sell you textbooks. We're tying to be different. We're the only <br />
 operation trying to deliver cheaper books, while giving you ads/deals <br />
 from local businesses to stretch your your funds!<br />

  here's why we're doing this, and how it will work<br />
  why:<br />
   books for your classes are too expensive and should cost less<br />
   we think theres a better way<br />
  the book platform shows you the books you need for the colleges/classes <br />
	in the system (~600 largest colleges)<br />
  books go directly from distributors to you, keeping costs low. we don't <br />
	pad for profit<br />
  you save!<br />

 and here's the how;<br />
  like almost everything else online, ads from businesss local to <br />
	college communities will support the site<br />
  -businesses are willing to advertise on the platform, "provided":<br />
   		-we show that users want to join for the books, and <br />
		-we show the user population "data" is a "fit" for the <br />
		 target customer for the the business<br />

	a win/win for students as well as businesses!<br />

This site/app is focused on giving the student information to <br />
 join the operation for getting cheaper books, and to grow the <br />
 community by referring other friends/students.<br />

The business who wants to advertise on the platform, should <br />
 check out the "bizLink" section for a short overview on what the <br />
 project offers Ad partners. More specific information for the <br />
  biz partner, can be found in the partner "bizSitePageLink"!<br />


possible "timer" counting down day/hr/min/<br />
possible counter for users joined for waitlist (just email)<br />
possible counter for users joined for userData (<br />
possible counter for users joined for Businesses (local/or total)<br />
